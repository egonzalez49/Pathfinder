# Pathfinder

A pathfinding visualization tool created with React. Visualize the shortest path from a start to an end node while watching the algorithm take place in real-time.

_Click and drag_ the mouse to create and remove walls preventing the pathfinding algorithm from advancing on that grid node.

## Algorithms

- Dijkstra's
- A*
