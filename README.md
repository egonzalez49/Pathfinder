# Pathfinder

A pathfinding visualization tool created with React. Visualize the shortest path from a start to an end node while watching the algorithm take place in real-time.

_Click and drag_ the mouse to create and remove walls preventing the pathfinding algorithm from advancing on that grid node. Also works to move the start and finish nodes.

## Algorithms

- Dijkstra's
- A\*

## Current Bugs

Sometimes it does not register a mouse up event and the user will need to click to stop the current action. Similarly, mouse down event is not recognized when moving a start or finish node.
